## [16.8.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- Added `ChannelOptions.IsLargeText` to allow a channel to be configured as a large text channel. With this feature enabled, text channels can support up to 2000 users.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that was restricting the usage of dots in channel names and player IDs.
- Fixed an issue that would cause a `NullReferenceException` when trying to use mute, volume, or device-related APIs while not signed in to the Vivox service.

## [16.7.0] - 2025-08-19
### Fixed
- Fixed memory leak caused by unbound event handlers preventing `VivoxParticipant` objects from being cleaned up when the local user left channels with remaining participants.

### Added
- `VivoxMessage.Metadata` property for accessing channel or directed message metadata.
- `MessageOptions.Metadata` property for attaching metadata to outgoing messages.
- Added automatic SDK initialization and user sign-in when SDK actions are attempted without prior setup.
- Added support for multiple concurrent Vivox SDK instances via `IUnityServices.GetVivoxService()`.

### Removed
- Removed Mint service integration and deprecated related public APIs.

### Changed
- Updated minimum supported Editor version to 2021.3.
- Updated Services Core SDK dependency version.

## [16.6.3] - 2025-08-06
### Added
- Added support for Nintendo Switch™ 2.

## [16.6.2] - 2025-06-17
### Added
- Android: Recompiled the native Android library `libVivoxNative.so` to support [16 KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) on devices running Android 15 or later.

### Changed
- Android: Unity SDK AAR library size has been decreased from 102 MB to 31 MB. This will in turn decrease game APK sizes.

## [16.6.1] - 2025-05-01
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where it would not be possible to join channels on Nintendo Switch™ when running in compatibility mode.

## [16.6.0] - 2025-03-31
### Changed
- The licenses and third party notices have been updated.
- Vivox Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Automatic Gain Control have had their underlying algorithms replaced.
    - Acoustic Echo Cancellation on mobile platforms no longer mutes the microphone signal when echo is detected. Instead, echo is removed and speech continues to transmit.
    - Automatic Gain Control is on by default. The new Automatic Gain Control increases microphone capture loudness on all platforms. Consider adjusting application volume presets if they were changed from the default volumes; perhaps going so far as to reset user volume settings entirely or to adjust them by some formula.
    - For platforms that already had Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Automatic Gain Control, the new implementation including the addition of Noise Suppression has:
        - The same or less CPU cost than the previous implementation when using the Release configuration.
        - A reduction in memory usage of about 11 MB while a voice session is active.
    - For platforms that are getting Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Automatic Gain Control for the first time:
        - CPU cost of the Vivox audio thread increases by about 44% when using the Release configuration.
        - An extra 6 MB of memory will be used while a voice session is active.
    - Vivox library sizes have increased for all platforms due to the change in audio processing implementations:
        - Release configuration libraries add between 53 KB and 8 MB more to an application than the previous Vivox release.
        - Debug configuration libraries can add upwards of 12 MB more to an application than the previous Vivox release.
- Network optimization: A new default voice codec bitrate was chosen to reduce packet loss and jitter. The new setting was found to be indistinguishable from the previous setting in structured listening tests.
- `iOS`:
    - The `VivoxConfigurationOptions.IosVoiceProcessingMode` value now defaults to 1 rather than 2, meaning that the VoiceProcessingIO (VPIO) unit will only be used when the speakerphone is used for render and capture. This change favors the use of the new Acoustic Echo Cancellation underlying algorithms rather than the use of the VPIO unit to avoid the decrease in quality for most audio device configurations that come from using the VPIO unit.
### Added
- Noise suppression: Now applied to capture audio by default. To change the settings, see the new `IVivoxGlobalAudioSettings` APIs.
- Vivox Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Automatic Gain Control are now available on all platforms. Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Automatic Gain Control were previously unavailable on Nintendo Switch™, PlayStation®, Xbox, visionOS, and UWP platforms.
- New `IVivoxGlobalAudioSettings` interface providing centralized control over Vivox audio processing features accessible through `VivoxService.Instance.VivoxGlobalAudioSettings`:
  - Noise suppression controls:
    - `NoiseSuppressionEnabled` to toggle background noise reduction
  - Echo cancellation settings:
    - `PlatformAcousticEchoCancellationEnabled` for mobile platform-native Acoustic Echo Cancellation
    - `VivoxAcousticEchoCancellationEnabled` for SDK-level Acoustic Echo Cancellation
  - Audio processing features:
    - `AutomaticGainControlEnabled` for input volume normalization
    - `DynamicVoiceProcessingSwitchingEnabled` for adaptive processing
    - `VolumeBasedDuplicationSuppressionEnabled` for multi-channel audio management
    - `PositionalChannelVolumeProtectionEnabled` for 3D audio distortion prevention
  - Clipping protection controls:
    - `AudioClippingProtectorEnabled` to toggle clipping prevention
    - `AudioClippingProtectorParameters` to fine-tune protection behavior
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where adjusting timeScale could prevent events from firing.
- Fixed an issue where creating an Android build with `Player Settings > Android settings > Publishing Settings > Minify` enabled would result in runtime errors.
- Vivox log levels were off-by-one. There may be more Vivox log statements now if the `VivoxConfigurationOptions.LogLevel` was set for your application.
### Removed
- `iOS`:
    - Removed bitcode in the iOS libraries.
    - Removed support for ARMV7 architecture on iOS platforms.

## [15.1.180001-pre.4] - 2022-08-08
### Changed
 - Adjusted the Windows and Mac VivoxNative library .meta files to enable `Load on Startup` so they get loaded in regardless of the build target of the editor. Notably, this caused compiler errors when entering Play Mode if the editor build target was iOS since our Mac library, which gets used for the editor alongside the Windows library, wasn't loaded yet.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue with various plugin `.meta` files not targeting their specific platform resulting in editor crashes when entering Play Mode if additional Vivox platform packages got installed.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause a compiler error if the Authentication package wasn't available to the ChatChannelSample. The Authentication package should get automatically pulled in when the ChatChannelSample is installed, but if it hadn't been, a compiler error would appear.

## [15.1.180001-pre.3] - 2022-07-13
